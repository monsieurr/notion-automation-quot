# Notion Automation Script

Automatically creates my daily notes in Notion given my personal pattern.

I use [notion-py](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py) to connect to Notion and automate.
You need to provide token_v2 available in your notion session cookies.
You'll also need to provide the url of the page you want to modify.
Follow notion-py documentation for extensive information.

I use [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to schedule the daily run of my script
